## Profile

I am a **Senior Data Analyst** with 5+ years of experience delivering high-impact analytics, automation, and data-driven decision support in complex business environments.

My core expertise lies in **analytics, data engineering, and business-oriented problem solving**, built through hands-on work with large-scale reporting systems, ETL pipelines, and cross-functional stakeholders.

In parallel, I am actively consolidating my profile as a **Data Scientist / GenAI Engineer**, focusing on the practical application of machine learning, LLMs, RAG pipelines, and AI agents to solve real analytical and operational problems.

## What I do

### Data Analytics & Business Impact
- Design and scale analytical pipelines that replace manual reporting with automated, reliable systems.
- Translate complex data into actionable insights for business, finance, and operations.
- Build SSOT architectures and analytics foundations to reduce cost, noise, and decision latency.

### Data Science & GenAI 
- Develop **LLM-powered analytical tools**, including NL-to-SQL agents and document-based RAG systems.
- Design AI pipelines with attention to **trade-offs, limitations, and evaluation**, not just demos.
- Prototype end-to-end solutions combining Python, DuckDB, LangChain, FAISS, and Streamlit.
